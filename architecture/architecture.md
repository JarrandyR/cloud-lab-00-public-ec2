# Architecture Overview — Cloud Lab 00

This lab deploys a minimal AWS environment consisting of:

- A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
- A public subnet
- An internet gateway
- A publicly reachable EC2 instance
- Security group–based network controls

The goal is to understand how attack surface is introduced as infrastructure becomes reachable.
